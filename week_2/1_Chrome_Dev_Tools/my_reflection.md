Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? 
The Document Object Model (DOM) makes each element of a webpage into an object.  Thus, the entirety of a webpage can be created, changed, and manipulated by an object-oriented programming language, like Ruby or Python.  This allows for the creation and programming of dynamic websites—they need not just be static, brochure-like pages.

The idea of converting every element (paragraphs, classes, ids, footers) into objects makes sense—it seems like a practical way of giving a programming language access to the page.  Given my introductory understanding of html/css and programming languages, however, this concept makes more sense to me than the actual practice. I’m excited to try it in the near future. 


What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM concept does seem to add a new layer of complexity to something I was already having trouble with: HTML/CSS.  Of course, I’ve only been learning these concepts for barely more than a week.  As well, I can completely understand that having some additional underlying complexity gives you much more room for creativity and flexibility once you have a handle on those (finite) complexities.  


How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
Not surprisingly, the html/css code for the <a href=”https://wronghands1.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/vintage-social-networking/” alt=”Wrong Hands”>wordpress site</a> I looked at was significantly more complex.  I learned that navigational bars across the top of the page are unordered lists (tho I’m still not sure how to construct these) and that you can write a css rule with a selector that is a combination of class and id.  That is, a class of “entry” within an id of “content” can have a css rule as follows:  #content .entry {property: value}. 


Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I found it really interesting to use Chrome’s Dev Tools.  It let me see my work in a new light (always helpful) and really strengthened my understanding of what my html and css documents look like.  It also gave me an idea as to how I might better organize my css documents.


Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
I’m slowly coming to learn that developing a more full sense/skill with html and css requires not just reading and doing with my own websites, but also reviewing and inspecting other websites.  This isn’t actually surprising, but it kinda dawned on me much more fully reviewing the wordpress site.
