What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I’m having a hard time seeing arguments against web standards.  First, they standardize things—they make it easier for everyone to understand each other.  Second, their very existence makes the web community argue over where web protocol needs to go: we have to examine what we all currently do, what we all want to do, and how we might get there.

Perhaps there is an argument that standards increase rules and stifle creativity.  But really, rules direct and actually encourage creativity.  For example, anything that could be accomplished prior to HTML5 can still be accomplished in HTML5, but just differently.  Another argument might be that changing standards breed obsolescence, but that is, of course, the price of change.

Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
The standard structure does make sense—though I’m sure my understanding of it (and maybe my impatience/intolerance of it) will grow with additional use.  It seems to be the result of websites containing the same type of elements—headers, articles, footers, sections, etc.  It’s essentially a way of standardizing ID and class types; perhaps I’m missing some greater aspect of the standard.

Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as <header>, footer, and nav? Why or why not?
I like the new elements.  They create standard tags for items that nearly all webpages have and thus make the HTML and CSS code more readable and organized.  Of course, not all websites are required to have such standardized elements, and nor does HTML5 require that:  we can still use other labels or identifiers using classes and ids, just as we did before HTML5. 

Why is reset.css necessary?
Reset.css resets css.  That is, reset.css negates the default style settings native to a browser and only shows styles specifically implemented by the designer’s own css code.  This allows for users to see a designer’s webpages more consistently, regardless of which browser they are using.

What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I have primarily used Chrome and Firefox, and to a lesser extent, Explorer.  The main reason I’ve chosen different browsers if because of functionality, not site appearance.  I honestly can’t think of noticing site variations based on browsers, but I don’t think it’s a particularly good thing, as it might lead to confusion.  For example, I might remember to hit a button based on how it looked in one browser (font size, etc.), and I might be confused for a moment if I saw it differently in another browser.  Though again, I don’t recall noticing variations or being confused by them myself.

<a href =”http://web.archive.org/web/20120618203051/http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-article-element”>HTML 5: a technical specification for Web developers</a>:  essentially a more technical listing of the new HTML 5 elements referenced by the required article.  It helped me to see it all laid out more clinically, even I didn’t read the entire site.

I used and liked the videos, quizzes, and coding challenges from the “How to Make a Website” of teamtreehouse.com (focusing on HTML and CSS).  It allowed me to reinforce last week’s lessons and gain some new tricks as well.
