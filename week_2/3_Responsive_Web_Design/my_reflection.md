What is responsive web design? Do you like it? Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive web design is a practice that makes websites work well and fluidly on any device (desktop, laptop, tablet, phone).  More than simply adjusting to the size of the screen (which is a big part of it—think percentages and ems instead of fixed pixel sizes), RWD adjusts content as well.  For example, on a small smartphone, we may reformat the a four-column website into a single column, and we may remove extraneous content and images to hone the design and user experience.  

It’s definitely a good practice.  Rather than the old way—designing multiple sites for multiple types of platforms—we instead acknowledge and tackle the problem from the beginning.

How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
Smartphones and tablets have challenged our notions of what webpages can and should look like.  As more sizes of these devices come up, and as we start to blur the lines between desktop and laptop, we as designers will have to adapt our approaches to web design.  For the moment, for example, we take it for granted that a smartphone is for someone on the go, but as technology changes, we may be able to use our small smartphone screens in more powerful ways, thus requiring newly designed webpage features.

How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
We’ve already seen that some of our design features help the visually impaired to understand our webpages.  For example, the “alt” portion of the “img” tag might explain what an image is to someone who cannot see the image but can listen to a reader interpret the tag.  

Whether a site should be developed and adapted specifically for visually impaired people varies depending on the site, the expected users, and the availability of technology to bridge the gap.  For example, if we are designing a site that sells paintings, then we might want to focus less on a visually impaired user.  But if we are designing a webpage for a music seller, then it may well be worth our while to take advantage of such technologies so that the visually impaired can benefit from the information and experience the site seeks to produce.

What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? 
I really like the explanation of how sites work on mobile phones.  I’ve definitely experienced this before (both responsive sites and specific mobile sites, the latter of which frequently annoys me), but I had never really thought about the design choices that go into producing that effect.

What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
I’m curious why we’re learning about Responsive Web Design the way we are.  Why did we learn pixel widths for objects and fonts from the beginning and then learn to adapt it with RWD?  Why didn’t we just learn ems and percentages from the start and then learn about media queries (maybe much later)?
