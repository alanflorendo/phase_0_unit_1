Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
It’s really both fun and frustrating, all simultaneously.  There are so many times where I think I’ve solved the problem; then I go to refresh, and no change.  I definitely feel very uneasy about my CSS capabilities.  Working on my own site made me feel like I have decent analytical skills and I can approach a page, play with it, and probably eventually develop something I like that is close to what I want.  But I am so far from having the skills to know what I can do on my own (without experimenting), to really think about what I want to do and how I will get that done.

What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
My process was largely playing around and compromise.  I would play with CSS stylings to try to get what I wanted.  Sometimes after a while, I’d get it to work; other times, after a while, I wouldn’t get it to work, and I’d have to come up with something different.

What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I’m still struggling for a purpose for my site—I don’t have a lot of content to go on the main page.  But I think I’d like to add a more complex navigation bar.

Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
Design and CSS are definitely not something that is coming to me naturally.  I am getting that CSS can be used to effect certain layout concepts.  And I have some understanding of the inner mechanics—using CSS to translate a layout idea into an actual website.  But I’m just not comfortable with it.  I’m pretty comfortable that I’m not a design expert (or even a design competent) after only two weeks, but that also makes me nervous.
