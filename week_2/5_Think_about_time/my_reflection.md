What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0?
My biggest challenge is balancing among these challenges:  (i) reviewing all of the materials/research DBC provides, (ii) trying to look smart and have attractive web pages, and (iii) digesting the important materials so that, once the program is over, I am adept with the marketable skills sought by employers in a junior developer.  On the one hand, it’s tempting to try to make your web pages look great—in some ways that’s great practice and it also reinforces the material.  On the other, it can be so time-consuming that it really prevents you from learning the other (perhaps more substantive) material. 
 
As between items (i) and (iii), I see item (i) as giving me the skills to be a great develop and mentor ten years down the road.  But item (iii) is the one that is going to get me the job at (or soon after) graduation.  I’m worried that my pitch is going to have to be “I totally get responsive web design and design thinking, but I’m kinda sketchy when it comes to coding in JavaScript.”  Balancing among these tasks is going to take finesse.
 
 
How will you combat that?
I will combat this conflict by trying to see the big picture and that these things all fit together.  I’m fortunate in having a good deal of free time during Phase 0 to really dedicate myself to these concepts and a great deal of enthusiasm. I just need to make sure I'm also semi-rested once Phase 0 ends.
 
What techniques will you try?
Meditation/yoga:  About ten years ago, I did 90 minutes of yoga once per week; this lasted for about two years.  I really enjoyed it as a complement to other exercise, but I don’t know if I noticed its brain/focus benefits specifically.  Since DBC allots time for yoga, I’m (slowly) getting back into practice in Phase 0, so I can take full advantage of it on site.  More generally, I do pursue long, hard gym workouts these days.  I’ve already had to cut back on them for Phase 0, and I’m trying to do more focused workouts in less time, a habit I think I’ll need this summer.
 
Growth Mindset:  I have mixed feelings about Carol Dweck’s book, but I definitely like the idea that we change our potential simply by changing the way we view learning, development, and intelligence.  I also appreciate when she points out that we can have growth mindsets in some areas and fixed in others.  I clearly see that the fixed mindset dominates certain parts of my life (and has for a long time), but I do feel that I have a strong growth mindset when it comes to engineering intelligence.  I hope to use this growth mindset as a confidence builder to get me through the tough times, to encourage me to work even harder, knowing that I can ultimately accomplish the curriculum we’re being given.
 
Small Habits:  I think it’s important to note that we are not just trying to survive 9 weeks or 18 weeks.  We are trying to become developers, and thus Phase 0 and the onsite session are great places to learn great habits.  I’m planning to focus on that—I can use this simple 9/18 week period as a short trial period to develop better habits.
 
What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
My plan is to focus on the curriculum—I’m trusting that DBC is directing us to the tools we need to be successful on site.  I’m trying to learn as much as possible, but also to create tools and a record of what I have learned, so that I can refresh myself when needed, both during Phase 0 and Phase 1.  I’m also using interactive tools (like Code Academy and Team Treehouse) to reinforce my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; these tools work particularly well for my kinesthetic learning style.
 
I’m looking forward to meeting people once we are all downtown, but I am also going to try to develop relationships with my cohort in Phase 0 so we can all hit the ground running, ready to use each other as teaching, learning, and supportive resources.
