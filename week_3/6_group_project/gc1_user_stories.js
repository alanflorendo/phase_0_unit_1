/*DBC 0.3.6:  USER STORIES
(from person 1: Alan Florendo)

As a teacher, I keep track of how many books each student in all of my classes reads.  
I would like to see these statistics for each class based on the number of books each 
student in that class has read: sum, mean (arithmetic average), and median (middle 
number for odd number of students, or arithmetic average of middle two numbers for 
even number of students).  

Note that each class may have different numbers of students.  In one class, I have 
seven students (their scores:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7); in another class, I have eight 
students (their scores: 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 7).  I would like to calculate the sum, 
mean, and median specifically for each of these two classes.  

Please contact me if my needs are unclear; Iâ€™d be happy to update this request to 
reflect any clarifications.  Many thanks for your help.
