3.6:  GROUP PROJECT

I was Person 1 in our group; my job was (i) to convert the test code into user stories, and (ii) to run the 
test code on the final refactored code submitted to me.  Of the six people in our group, I have met three, 
have yet to meet two, and am one.  

After having done HTML and CSS for two weeks, this project was my first DBC foray into algorithms.  Since 
I was Person 1, I focused on getting my user stories out to the group even before I had a real grasp on how 
JavaScript worked (though I assumed it would be similar to C or Ruby, which I understand somewhat better).  
As the first and last person in the chain, I knew that everyone had to be done before I could finish my 
work.

But otherwise, there was not a strong group dynamic for this project.  I worked alone as Person 1.  (The 
roles of Person 3 and Person 4 were each filled by two persons, four total).  I passed my work along to 
one person, who never needed to communicate back with me.  And I received my work from one team of two 
people, and I never needed to work with them.  (I did communicate to the team that our project had been 
	a success.)  So the project involved a group of people in sequence, but not necessarily together.  
There were no major issues with communication, power, empathy, etc.

That said, I did find the project very insightful.  In particular, the project emphasizes the role of 
pseudocode and refactoring in coding.  I definitely appreciate that pseudocoding is necessary: it makes 
your code readable to others as well as to yourself.  (Even a few days after writing it, your own 
	uncommented code can be completely bewildering.)  When you’re coding for yourself, I can see that 
it’s easy to write sloppy pseudocode and still turn it into the right code.  Here in our group project, 
however, that wouldn’t have been the answer.  In fact, if our coders wanted to write different code than 
the pseudocode given to them, they had to get the pseudocoder himself to revise the pseudocode beforehand.  
I’m actually really proud of my team’s ability to go through this process cleanly: state and understand 
the problem, pseudocode an algorithm, code the pseudocode, and refactor the code.  I appreciate the 
project’s ability to clarify these important and separate processes.
